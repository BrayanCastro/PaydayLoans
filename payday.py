# Project: PaydayLoans
# Description: For this program I have developed a program that calculates the APR of a payday loan in the two scenarios listed below.  
# (1) I know the total loan amount or amount the borrower will receive , the total fee or cost of the loan, and the length of the loan (in days or months)
# (2) I know the fee in dollars (or percent) for every 100 dollars borrowed and the length of the loan (in days or months

def main():

  print("Please tell us so we can calculate APR by Selecting which one that fits your situation.")

  print("(2) I know the fee in dollars (or percent) for every 100 dollars borrowed and the length of the loan (in days or months")
